  abstract = {The recent Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) requirement that hospital accreditation be based upon a Total Quality Management (TQM) approach has focused the attention of health care administrations on the use of techniques such as control charts. However, control charts are not typically adjusted for severity of illness. This adjustment is needed because, unlike industrial organizations, hospitals are not able to control all of their inputs and must accept variances in their patients. In this paper, we present a methodology for adjusting a health care organization's control charts to reflect their patient population's severity of illness during different time intervals. We then demonstrate that risk-adjusting expected patient outcomes can change our assessments of the relative quality of care offered by a health care organization in different time periods.}

They are a continuous observed outcome collected over time across a sample of patients, and an expected outcome for each patient.

They then reviewed data showing blood glucose levels of 60 Type 2 diabetes patients in a family practice clinic of five providers. The data covered a period of 21 consecutive months. They present the data relating to two of the providers using this set of data to demonstrate how to create a risk-adjusted X-bar control chart.

  abstract = {Abstract             Since the 1980s, the demographic literature has suggested that maternal schooling plays a key role in determining children’s chances of survival in low- and middle-income countries; however, few studies have successfully identified a causal relationship between maternal education and under-5 mortality. To identify such a causal effect, we exploited exogenous variation in maternal education induced by schooling reforms introducing universal primary education in the second half of the 1990s in Malawi and Uganda. Using a two-stage residual inclusion approach and combining individual-level data from Demographic and Health Surveys with district-level data on the intensity of the reform, we tested whether increased maternal schooling reduced children’s probability of dying before age 5. In Malawi, for each additional year of maternal education, children have a 10 \% lower probability of dying; in Uganda, the odds of dying for children of women with one additional year of education are 16.6 \% lower. We also explored which pathways might explain this effect of maternal education. The estimates suggest that financial barriers to medical care, attitudes toward modern health services, and rejection of domestic violence may play a role. Moreover, being more educated seems to confer enhanced proximity to a health facility and knowledge about the transmission of AIDS in Malawi, and wealth and improved personal illness control in Uganda.},

By doing so, it offers the first shift from the individual reflective practitioner to processes of collective and public reflection. The unique and varied contributions focus on the development of notions such as public reflection, collective reflection, and critical reflection. In doing so, they provide critical insights into new thinking and approaches to the role of reflection in organizations, as well as the conceptualization and delivery of learning and change. Organizing Reflection will be of interest to scholars working in business, professional, management and organization studies, to human development academics, and to scholarly practitioners in organizations.},

  abstract = {Continuous improvement of product, process and service quality is important for today's organisations to remain competitive in global marketplaces. Statistical process control (SPC) is an important and powerful technique for the continuous improvement of product and process quality. The control chart is the familiar tool used within SPC for determining out‐of‐control situations and thereby eliminating or reducing variation in processes. However, a control chart is by no means the only ingredient – nor necessarily the most important – for the successful application of SPC. This paper identifies and discusses these key ingredients for the successful application of SPC in both manufacturing and service organisations.}

However, hardly any empirical studies em ploying real data are available that attest to the tena bility of these proposals. A systematic analysis of the problem was undertaken, using self-report data from two large phobic samples on the Fear Survey Sched ule-III (N = 1104) and the Fear Questionnaire (N = 960). The data sets were randomly split into subsam ples with ratios varying from 1.3:1 to 19.8:1. Neither the observations to variables ratio nor an absolute minimum of observations had any influence on factor stability.}

Through the adoption and widespread use of data statements, the field can begin to address critical scientific and ethical issues that result from the use of data from certain populations in the development of technology for other populations. We present a form that data statements can take and explore the implications of adopting them as part of regular practice. We argue that data statements will help alleviate issues related to exclusion and bias in language technology, lead to better precision in claims about how natural language processing research can generalize and thus better engineering results, protect companies from public embarrassment, and ultimately lead to language technology that meets its users in their own preferred linguistic style and furthermore does not misrepresent them to others.},

  abstract = {Improvement of health care requires making changes in processes of care and service delivery. Although process performance is measured to determine if these changes are having the desired beneficial effects, this analysis is complicated by the existence of natural variation-that is, repeated measurements naturally yield different values and, even if nothing was done, a subsequent measurement might seem to indicate a better or worse performance. Traditional statistical analysis methods account for natural variation but require aggregation of measurements over time, which can delay decision making. Statistical process control (SPC) is a branch of statistics that combines rigorous time series analysis methods with graphical presentation of data, often yielding insights into the data more quickly and in a way more understandable to lay decision makers. SPC and its primary tool-the control chart-provide researchers and practitioners with a method of better understanding and communicating data from healthcare improvement efforts. This paper provides an overview of SPC and several practical examples of the healthcare applications of control charts.},

  abstract = {In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimated across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters. The bias–variance dilemma or bias–variance problem is the conflict in trying to simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training set: The bias error is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting). The variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance may result from an algorithm modeling the random noise in the training data (overfitting).The bias–variance decomposition is a way of analyzing a learning algorithm's expected generalization error with respect to a particular problem as a sum of three terms, the bias, variance, and a quantity called the irreducible error, resulting from noise in the problem itself.},

Det er vanlig å regne tiden fra omkring 500 til omkring 1500 til middelalderen. Middelalderen begynner med at den vestlige delen av Romerriket ble oppløst, og nye riker ble etablert i Europa. Perioden kjennetegnes av spredning av kristendommen, etablering av føydalsamfunn og økt makt til kirke, konger og fyrster.},

The worm plot is a diagnostic tool for visualizing how well a statistical model fits the data, for finding locations at which the fit can be improved, and for comparing the fit of different models. This paper shows how the worm plot can be used in conjunction with quantile regression. No parametric distributional assumptions are needed to create the worm plot. We fitted both an LMS and a quantile regression model on Dutch height data. The worm plot shows that the quantile regression model is superior to the LMS model in terms of fit. At the same time, it also contains a warning that the particular quantile model used may actually overfit the data. The resulting quantile curves are wiggly at the extremes, and appear less well suited for drawing growth diagrams. The paper concludes that the worm plot is a natural diagnostic tool for quantile regression.},

  abstract = {A recent article by Jamieson in Medical Education outlined some of the (alleged) abuses of “Likert scales” with suggestions about how researchers can overcome some of the (alleged) methodological pitfalls and limitations[1]. However, many of the ideas advanced in the Jamison article, as well as a great many of articles it cited, and similar recent articles in medical, health, psychology, and educational journals and books, are themselves common misunderstandings, misconceptions, conceptual errors, persistent myths and “urban legends” about “Likert scales” and their characteristics and qualities that have been propagated and perpetuated across six decades, for a variety of different reasons. This article identifies, analyses and traces many of these aforementioned problems and presents the arguments, counter arguments and empirical evidence that show these many persistent claims and myths about “Likert scales” to be factually incorrect and untrue. Many studies have shown that Likert Scales (as opposed to single Likert response format items) produce interval data and that the F-test is very robust to violations of the interval data assumption and moderate skewing and may be used to analyze “Likert data” (even if it is ordinal), but not on an item-by-item “shotgun” basis, which is simply a current research and analysis practice that must stop. After sixty years, it is more than time to dispel these particular research myths and urban legends as well as the various damage and problems they cause, and put them to bed and out of their misery once and for all.},

  abstract = {The Laney p′ control chart is a new type of attribute control chart that can be applied in situations where the process exhibits either overdispersion or underdispersion. While it has gained acceptance in the industry, there is still limited knowledge about its effectiveness in detecting process variation. It is well known that before applying a control chart, understanding its performance is crucial, especially when the parameters of the control chart need to be estimated from historical data. In this study, we used simulations to investigate the ability of the Laney p′ control chart to detect process variations when the parameters are estimated. We designed appropriate experiments to assess the impact of overdispersion on the average run length (ARL) performance. In this study, we assumed that the overdispersion comes from the variation in the mean fraction nonconforming of each sample. The mean value varies according to a uniform distribution. This study evaluated the performance of the Laney p′ control chart using the average of the ARL (AARL) and the standard deviation of the ARL (SDARL). Additionally, real-world data were utilized to illustrate the practical applications of the Laney p′ control chart in the PCB and IC substrate industries. The research findings can serve as valuable guidance for practical implementation.},

  abstract = {Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.},

  abstract = {The scholarship of management teaching and learning has established itself as a field in its own right and this benchmark handbook is the first to provide an account of the discipline.   Original chapters from leading international academics identify the key issues and map out where the discipline is going. Each chapter provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the given topic area, highlights current debates and reviews the emerging research agenda.   Chapters embrace the study of organizations as a whole, the concepts of individual and collective learning, the delivery of formal management education and the facilitation of management development. Through consideration of these themes the Handbook analyzes, promotes and critiques the contribution of management learning, education and development to management understanding. It will be an invaluable point of reference for all students and researchers interested in broadening their understanding of this exciting and dynamic new field.},

  abstract = {To partly address people's concerns over web tracking, Google has created the Ad Settings webpage to provide information about and some choice over the profiles Google creates on users. We present AdFisher, an automated tool that explores how user behaviors, Google's ads, and Ad Settings interact. AdFisher can run browser-based experiments and analyze data using machine learning and significance tests. Our tool uses a rigorous experimental design and statistical analysis to ensure the statistical soundness of our results. We use AdFisher to find that the Ad Settings was opaque about some features of a user's profile, that it does provide some choice on ads, and that these choices can lead to seemingly discriminatory ads. In particular, we found that visiting webpages associated with substance abuse changed the ads shown but not the settings page. We also found that setting the gender to female resulted in getting fewer instances of an ad related to high paying jobs than setting it to male. We cannot determine who caused these findings due to our limited visibility into the ad ecosystem, which includes Google, advertisers, websites, and users. Nevertheless, these results can form the starting point for deeper investigations by either the companies themselves or by regulatory bodies.},

Can transparency contribute to restoring accountability for such systems? Several objections are examined: the loss of privacy when data sets become public, the perverse effects of disclosure of the very algorithms themselves ('gaming the system' in particular), the potential loss of competitive edge, and the limited gains in answerability to be expected since sophisticated algorithms are inherently opaque. It is concluded that transparency is certainly useful, but only up to a point: extending it to the public at large is normally not to be advised. Moreover, in order to make algorithmic decisions understandable, models of machine learning to be used should either be interpreted ex post or be interpretable by design ex ante.},

The ethical principles that guide clinical research involving human subjects require that all participants in such trials be provided available measures known to reduce the risk of HIV infection. However, this will reduce the ability of the study to assess the protective effect of the test microbicide. In addition, providing extensive services to trial participants may be construed as an undue inducement if the study is being conducted among vulnerable groups such as sex workers or women from disadvantaged communities. Suggestions are provided to resolve this dilemma in the planning and implementation of HIV prevention services for trial participants.},

  abstract = {Significance             We propose genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression—a method that controls for pleiotropic effects of genes on two variables. GIV regression is broadly applicable to study outcomes for which polygenic scores from large-scale genome-wide association studies are available. We explore the performance of GIV regression in the presence of pleiotropy across a range of scenarios and find that it yields more accurate estimates than alternative approaches such as ordinary least-squares regression or Mendelian randomization. When GIV regression is combined with proper controls for purely environmental sources of bias (e.g., using control variables and sibling fixed effects), it improves our understanding of the causal relationships between genetically correlated variables.           ,              Identifying causal effects in nonexperimental data is an enduring challenge. One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables [i.e., Mendelian randomization (MR)]. However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in nonexperimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from nongenetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGSs) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into nonoverlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGSs that can be used as instruments for each other and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Quality aspects of the anesthetic process are reflected in the rate of intraoperative adverse events. The purpose of this report is to illustrate how the quality of the anesthesia process can be analyzed using statistical process control methods, and exemplify how this analysis can be used for quality improvement. METHODS We prospectively recorded anesthesia-related data from all anesthetics for five years. The data included intraoperative adverse events, which were graded into four levels, according to severity. We selected four adverse events, representing important quality and safety aspects, for statistical process control analysis. These were: inadequate regional anesthesia, difficult emergence from general anesthesia, intubation difficulties and drug errors. We analyzed the underlying process using 'p-charts' for statistical process control. RESULTS In 65,170 anesthetics we recorded adverse events in 18.3\%; mostly of lesser severity. Control charts were used to define statistically the predictable normal variation in problem rate, and then used as a basis for analysis of the selected problems with the following results: Inadequate plexus anesthesia: stable process, but unacceptably high failure rate; Difficult emergence: unstable process, because of quality improvement efforts; Intubation difficulties: stable process, rate acceptable; Medication errors: methodology not suited because of low rate of errors. CONCLUSION By applying statistical process control methods to the analysis of adverse events, we have exemplified how this allows us to determine if a process is stable, whether an intervention is required, and if quality improvement efforts have the desired effect.},

In addition, it includes power analyses for z tests and some exact tests. G*Power 3 provides improved effect size calculators and graphic options, supports both distribution-based and design-based input modes, and offers all types of power analyses in which users might be interested. Like its predecessors, G*Power 3 is free.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is widely used by researchers in the social sciences to characterize the latent structure underlying a set of observed indicator variables. One of the primary issues that must be resolved when conducting an EFA is determination of the number of factors to retain. There exist a large number of statistical tools designed to address this question, with none being universally optimal across applications. Recently, researchers have investigated the use of model fit indices that are commonly used in the conduct of confirmatory factor analysis to determine the number of factors to retain in EFA. These results have yielded mixed results, appearing to be effective when used in conjunction with normally distributed indicators, but not being as effective for categorical indicators. The purpose of this simulation study was to compare the performance of difference values for several fit indices as a method for identifying the optimal number of factors to retain in an EFA, with parallel analysis, which is one of the most reliable such extant methods. Results of the simulation demonstrated that the use of fit index difference values outperformed parallel analysis for categorical indicators, and for normally distributed indicators when factor loadings were small. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping               data ethics               as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). Data ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the variety of digital technologies that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity of the ethical challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact and implications of data science and its applications within a consistent, holistic and inclusive framework. Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions that can maximize the value of data science for our societies, for all of us and for our environments.                          This article is part of the themed issue ‘The ethical impact of data science’.},

Archaeological findings of stone and bone implements, the remains of primitive dwellings built of wood and skins, and large accumulations of mammoths’ bones indicate that the first settlements in the vicinity date from the Late Paleolithic Period (some 40,000 to 15,000 years ago). As early as 3000 bce, Neolithic tribes engaging in agriculture and animal husbandry—notably the Trypillya culture of the mid-5th to 3rd millennium bce—lived on the site of modern Kyiv. Excavations continue to uncover many artifacts from settlements dating from the Copper, Bronze,},

Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

  abstract = {When it comes to artificial intelligence and inequality, algorithmic bias rightly receives a lot of attention. But it’s just one way that AI can lead to inequitable outcomes. To truly create equitable AI, we need to consider three forces through which it might make society more or less equal: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces. The last of these is particularly underemphasized. The use of AI in a product can change how much customers value it — for example, patients who put less stock in an algorithmic diagnosis — which in turn can affect how that product is used and how those working alongside it are compensated.},

  abstract = {CIO's achieve IT and business strategy alignment while effectively managing IT expenses using project portfolio governance tenets advanced in the early 2000's. However, today's IT context is characterized by the proliferation of big data, business intelligence and predictive analytics projects often incubated in business units but that require IT's commitment for effective deployment. For CIO's, the IT governance approaches of the past need to be augmented with new methods, exemplars and reference models. We discuss three pillars to IT governance for this new era: a general model of big data and analytical solution deployment, a summary of current industry best practices and a taxonomy of plan, design and execution imperatives. These pillars provide foundation for an Analytics Capability Reference Model that has been validated in industry settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Numerous rules-of-thumb have been suggested for determining the minimum number of subjects required to conduct multiple regression analyses. These rules-of-thumb are evaluated by comparing their results against those based on power analyses for tests of hypotheses of multiple and partial correlations. The results did not support the use of rules-of-thumb that simply specify some constant (e.g., 100 subjects) as the minimum number of subjects or a minimum ratio of number of subjects (N) to number of predictors (m). Some support was obtained for a rule-of-thumb that N ≥ 50 + 8 m for the multiple correlation and N ≥104 + m for the partial correlation. However, the rule-of-thumb for the multiple correlation yields values too large for N when m ≥ 7, and both rules-of-thumb assume all studies have a medium-size relationship between criterion and predictors. Accordingly, a slightly more complex rule-of thumb is introduced that estimates minimum sample size as function of effect size as well as the number of predictors. It is argued that researchers should use methods to determine sample size that incorporate effect size.}

  abstract = {Clustering, in data mining, is useful for discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions in the underlying data. Traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very fragile in the presence of outliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called CURE that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. CURE achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are generated by selecting               well scattered               points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative point per cluster allows CURE to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. To handle large databases, CURE employs a combination of               random sampling               and               partitioning               . A random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is               partially               clustered. The partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. Our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by CURE is much better than those found by existing algorithms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling and partitioning enable CURE to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing clustering quality.},

  abstract = {Just as there are different interpretations of probability, leading to different kinds of inferential statements and different conclusions about statistical models and questions, so there are different theories of measurement, which in turn may lead to different kinds of statistical model and possibly different conclusions. This has led to much confusion and a long running debate about when different classes of statistical methods may legitimately be applied. This paper outlines the major theories of measurement and their relationships and describes the different kinds of models and hypotheses which may be formulated within each theory. One general conclusion is that the domains of applicability of the two major theories are typically different, and it is this which helps apparent contradictions to be avoided in most practical applications.}

  abstract = {This article proposes a new class of control charts that may be used for monitoring and improving the quality of care. Unlike conventional control charts that rely on observed performance data, these charts use risk-adjusted data in addition to the observed data. The resulting time-ordered charts are capable of reducing time-to-time variation that may stem from uncontrollable changes in patient mix over time. Depending on how observed and risk-adjusted data are combined, proposed charts are categorized under the framework of either additive or multiplicative models. Risk-adjusted rates are obtained using multivariate logistic regression models. It was found that the risk-adjusted control charts could be effective in reducing biases that arise from variation in patient mix. These charts can potentially achieve higher sensitivity and specificity compared with ordinary control charts.},

The present article discusses a similar class of control charts applicable for variables data that are often skewed. The key feature of these charts is their application of risk-adjusted data in addition to actual performance data. The resulting charts should decrease the occurrence of both type I and type II errors as compared to the unadjusted control charts. This article presents several control charts that vary in the data transformation and combination approaches. Data depicting hospital length of stay following coronary artery bypass graft procedures were used to illustrate the use of transformed and risk-adjusted control charts.},

A procedure based on the generation of random variables is given for estimating the component which needs to be subtracted.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to fill three gaps in the literature of quality control. First, this study expounds the chronological development of statistical quality control (SQC) to date, for there is a paucity of an up-to-date chronology of SQC in the literature. Second, the concept of statistical quality control has been analysed from the perspective of scientific inquiry to determine whether SQC has evolved or has been evolving as an evolutionary, revolutionary or progressive research program. Third, this paper discusses whether the discipline of statistical quality control has its own research tradition. We employed a qualitative method to address our research questions. We argue that the concept of statistical quality control has emerged as a scientific revolution in the arena of quality control and that the discipline of statistical quality control has its own research tradition. This study provides both practitioners and academicians with not only an up-to-date account of SQC but a sense of the legitimacy of SQC as a discipline. SQC provides a system's perspective to quality control and has paved the way for enterprise-wide quality philosophies such as TQC, TQM, zero defects, Six Sigma, ISO, etc.}

  abstract = {Publisher Summary Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a statistical strategy specifically designed to identify and explore hypothetical constructs as manifest in fallible indicators. The allure of CFA over other approaches to the study of hypothetical constructs is the capacity for testing detailed hypotheses in a deductive mode. Moreover, CFA models can be incorporated directly into general structural equation modeling (SEM) that includes directional relations among hypothetical constructs. It is noted that the central concern of CFA is modeling factors, sometimes referred to as latent variables. Factors are influences that are not directly measured, but account for commonality among a set of measurements. Recent developments in technical aspects of estimation and testing coupled with widely accessible and user-friendly software have rendered CFA more popular and appealing than ever. However, with the increased accessibility of CFA comes a responsibility to understand the conditions under which CFA is appropriately applied and the factors relevant to interpretation of CFA results.},

  abstract = {AIMS To illustrate the construction of statistical control charts and show their potential application to analysis of outcomes in children's surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two datasets recording outcomes following esophageal atresia repair and intestinal resection for Crohn's disease maintained by the author were used to construct four types of charts. The effects of altering the target signal, the alarm signal and the limits are illustrated. The dilemmas in choice of target rate are described. Simulated data illustrate the advantages over hypothesis testing. RESULTS The charts show the author's institutional leak rate for esophageal atresia repair may be within acceptable limits, but that this is dependent on the target set. The desirable target is contentious. The leak rate for anastomoses following intestinal resection for Crohn's disease leak is also within acceptable limits when compared to published experience, but may be deteriorating. The charts are able to detect deteriorating levels of performance well before hypothesis testing would suggest a systematic problem with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Statistical process control charts can provide surgeons with early warning of systematic poor performance. They are robust to volume-outcome influences, since the outcome is tested sequentially after each procedure or patient. They have application in a specialty with low frequencies of operations such as children's surgery. TYPE OF STUDY Diagnostic test. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II.},

  abstract = {Objective Measurements from health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) studies, although usually of an ordered categorical nature, are typically treated as continuous variables, allowing the calculation of mean values and the administration of parametric statistics, such as t-tests. We investigated whether parametric, compared to nonparametric, analyses of ordered categorical data may lead to different conclusions. Study Design and Setting HRQoL data were obtained from patients with a diagnosis of asthma (n = 192) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 88) at two time points. The impact of the group factor (asthma vs. COPD) and the time factor (t1 vs. t2) on HRQoL was analyzed with a metric approach (repeated measures ANOVA) and two ordinal approaches (each with a nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA). Results Using the metric approach, a significant effect of “group” (P = 0.0061) and “time” (P = 0.0049) on HRQoL was found. The first ordinal approach (ranked total score) still showed a significant effect for “group” (P = 0.0033) with a worse HRQoL for patients suffering from COPD. In the second approach (ranks for each HRQoL item and summed ranks), there were no significant effects. Conclusion Applying simple parametric methods to ordered categorical HRQoL scores led to different results from those obtained with nonparametric methods. In these cases, an ordinal approach will prevent inappropriate conclusions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Given the growing popularity of nonprobability samples as a cost- and time-efficient alternative to probability sampling, a variety of adjustment approaches have been proposed to correct for self-selection bias in nonrandom samples. Popular methods such as inverse propensity-score weighting (IPSW) and propensity-score (PS) adjustment by subclassification (PSAS) utilize a probability sample as a reference to estimate pseudo-weights for the nonprobability sample based on PSs. A recent contribution, kernel weighting (KW), has been shown to be able to improve over IPSW and PSAS with respect to mean squared error. However, the effectiveness of these methods for reducing bias critically depends on the ability of the underlying propensity model to reflect the true (self-)selection process, which is a challenging task with parametric regression. In this study, we propose a set of pseudo-weights construction methods, KW-ML, utilizing both machine learning (ML) methods (to estimate PSs) and KW (to construct pseudo-weights based on the ML-estimated PSs), which provides added flexibility over logistic regression-based methods. We compare the proposed KW-ML pseudo-weights that are based on model-based recursive partitioning, conditional random forests, gradient tree boosting, and model-based boosting, with KW pseudo-weights based on parametric logistic regression in population mean estimation via simulations and a real data example. Our results indicate that particularly boosting methods represent promising alternatives to logistic regression and result in KW estimates with lower bias in a variety of settings, without increasing variance.},

In such documents as the Code of Federal Regulations that govern clinical research, it is explicitly stated that informed consent is a process, not a form to be signed. However, virtually all research on informed consent has proceeded as if informed consent is an event similar to a Miranda warning. The authors review what is known about the process of informed consent and ask what questions must be explored if the dynamics of the clinical decision-making process are to be better understood. Their investigation takes place in two parts. First, the authors survey what is known or not known about the effect and influence of two major parties to the decision-making process (ie, support groups in which the subject participates and the subject’s primary care physician). Second, they focus on the cultural and demographic factors that contribute to the subject’s identity. Although they do not propose that informed consent must become a complicated and burdensome process, they stress that understanding the process in any meaningful way will mean that one must understand these various influences to get beyond the voluminous, but often facile, research that has characterized work on informed consent.},

These arguments are concerned with (1) the insensitivity of ordinal and other nonparametric techniques, (2) the small error that results from assigning numbers to ordinal data and then treating the categories as if they conform to an interval scale, (3) tests of statistical robustness, and (4) the power-efficiency of tests. The utility of assigning numbers or scoring systems to ordinal data and then using intervally-based statistics is supported in several ways. In addition, it is demonstrated that the linear scoring system results in a small amount of error no matter what the "true" scoring system may be. However, the assignment of any scoring system must be consistent with the monotonic function.}

This study attempts to implement CCPs classifiers which are capable of dealing with CCPs with different level of noise. Extracting image processing statistical features is adopted as preprocessing technique. The work also investigates the effect of level of noise in classification. Three different types of techniques for implementing classifiers are selected, these are Decision Tree, Neural network and an evolutionary based program, known as Self-adjusting Association Rules Generator (SARG). It was found that SARG yielded the best performance among them. To date, this study is an attempt to classify particular model of CCPs with highest level of noise.},

  abstract = {Los Angeles (US:  (listen) lawss AN-jəl-əs; Spanish: Los Ángeles [los ˈaŋxeles], lit.\,'The Angels'), often referred to by its initials L.A., is the largest city in California. With a 2020 population of 3,898,747  it is the second-largest city in the United States following New York City. Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic and cultural diversity, Hollywood film industry, and sprawling metropolitan area. The city of Los Angeles lies in a basin in Southern California. Adjacent to the Pacific Ocean extending through the Santa Monica Mountains and into the San Fernando Valley it covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2). It is the seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with just over 10 million residents in 2020. Home to the Chumash and Tongva indigenous peoples, the area that became Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and thus became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California. Los Angeles has a diverse and robust economy, and hosts businesses in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. It also has the busiest container port in the Americas. In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over \$1.0 trillion, making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after Tokyo and New York City. Los Angeles hosted the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics and will host the 2028 Summer Olympics.},

The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.

  abstract = {PURPOSE               This study was developed to determine whether descriptive information from a patient-completed questionnaire could provide prognostic information that was independent from that already obtained by the patient's physician.                                         PATIENTS AND METHODS               An initial detailed questionnaire was administered to approximately 150 patients with advanced cancer. This questionnaire was subsequently revised and given to a total of 1,115 patients with advanced colorectal or lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the data from these questionnaires.                                         RESULTS               A total of 36 variables showed statistically significant prognostic information for survival in univariate analyses, even though many of these variables were associated with only a minimal increase in risk. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was a high correlation between many variables. Three major groups of variables became apparent as providing strong prognostic information. These included the following: (1) a physician's assessment of performance status (PS); (2) a patient's assessment of their own PS; and (3) a nutritional factor such as appetite, caloric intake, or overall food intake.                                         CONCLUSION               Data generated by a patient-completed questionnaire can provide important prognostic information independent from that obtained by other physician-determined prognostic factors.},

  abstract = {The associations of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with stroke and with coronary heart disease (CHD) were investigated in nine major prospective observational studies: total 420 000 individuals, 843 strokes, and 4856 CHD events, 6-25 (mean 10) years of follow-up. The combined results demonstrate positive, continuous, and apparently independent associations, with no significant heterogeneity of effect among different studies. Within the range of DBP studied (about 70-110 mm Hg), there was no evidence of any "threshold" below which lower levels of DBP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD. Previous analyses have described the uncorrected associations of DBP measured just at "baseline" with subsequent disease rates. But, because of the diluting effects of random fluctuations in DBP, these substantially underestimate the true associations of the usual DBP (ie, an individual's long-term average DBP) with disease. After correction for this "regression dilution" bias, prolonged differences in usual DBP of 5,7·5, and 10 mm Hg were respectively associated with at least 34\%, 46\%, and 56\% less stroke and at least 21\%. 29\%, and 37\% less CHD. These associations are about 60\% greater than in previous uncorrected analyses. (This regression dilution bias is quite general, so analogous corrections to the relations of cholesterol to CHD or of various other risk factors to C H D or to other diseases would likewise increase their estimated strengths.) The DBP results suggest that for the large majority of individuals, whether conventionally "hypertensive" or "normotensive", a lower blood pressure should eventually confer a lower risk of vascular disease.}

Investigators working with diverse populations throughout the world face myriad challenges. The application of standards for informed consent can be daunting for researchers when they face the pragmatic constraints of the field and the reality of cultural beliefs about consent that may be in direct conflict with regulatory requirements. This paper explores cultural and social factors underlying informed consent for health research with diverse populations in international settings. Sociocultural influences on comprehension of information, perceptions of risk, and beliefs regarding decisional authority are reviewed. The implications of power inequities between study sponsors, researchers and participants are also considered. Issues associated with the development and preparation of consent forms, including translation and documentation are highlighted. Recommendations for good practices are outlined and future directions for research are explored.},

  abstract = {There are growing discontinuities between the research practices of data science and established tools of research ethics regulation. Some of the core commitments of existing research ethics regulations, such as the distinction between research and practice, cannot be cleanly exported from biomedical research to data science research. Such discontinuities have led some data science practitioners and researchers to move toward rejecting ethics regulations outright. These shifts occur at the same time as a proposal for major revisions to the Common Rule—the primary regulation governing human-subjects research in the USA—is under consideration for the first time in decades. We contextualize these revisions in long-running complaints about regulation of social science research and argue data science should be understood as continuous with social sciences in this regard. The proposed regulations are more flexible and scalable to the methods of non-biomedical research, yet problematically largely exclude data science methods from human-subjects regulation, particularly uses of public datasets. The ethical frameworks for Big Data research are highly contested and in flux, and the potential harms of data science research are unpredictable. We examine several contentious cases of research harms in data science, including the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion study and the 2016 use of geographical data techniques to identify the pseudonymous artist Banksy. To address disputes about application of human-subjects research ethics in data science, critical data studies should offer a historically nuanced theory of “data subjectivity” responsive to the epistemic methods, harms and benefits of data science and commerce.},

At the heart of this work is the concern that algorithms are often opaque, biased, and unaccountable tools being wielded in the interests of institutional power. These critiques and investigations are often insightful and illuminating, and they have done a good job of disabusing us of the notion that algorithms are purely objective. But there is a pattern among these critics, which is that they rarely ask how well the systems they analyze would operate without algorithms. And that is the most relevant question for practitioners and policy makers: How do the bias and performance of algorithms compare with those of human beings? It’s no secret that algorithms are biased. But the humans they are replacing are significantly more biased. After all, where do institutional biases come from if not the humans who have traditionally been in charge?},

  abstract = {The Gap statistic is a standard method for determining the number of clusters in a set of data. The Gap statistic standardizes the graph of \$\textbackslash log(W\_\{k\})\$, where \$W\_\{k\}\$ is the within-cluster dispersion, by comparing it to its expectation under an appropriate null reference distribution of the data. We suggest to use \$W\_\{k\}\$ instead of \$\textbackslash log(W\_\{k\})\$, and to compare it to the expectation of \$W\_\{k\}\$ under a null reference distribution. In fact, whenever a number fulfills the original Gap statistic inequality, this number also fulfills the inequality of a Gap statistic using \$W\_\{k\}\$, but not \textbackslash textit\{vice versa\}. The two definitions of the Gap function are evaluated on several simulated data sets and on a real data of DCE-MR images.},

A key aspect of continuous improvement is the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of variation. Consider, for example, the data in table 1 which shows surgeon specific mortality rates after colorectal cancer surgery.1 Ranking the mortality rates or the adjusted hazard ratios, with or without statistical tests, invites the interpretation that some surgeons are better than others. Furthermore, since a hazard ratio of 1 is defined as neutral, surgeons with a hazard ratio above 1 are considered a hazard to their patients. So, by categorising the hazard ratio as either acceptable or unacceptable, the study concludes that “some surgeons perform less than optimal surgery; some are less competent technically than their colleagues…” To improve outcomes the next logical step is to stop the less competent surgeons from operating and transfer their patients to the more competent surgeons. Surprisingly, perhaps, there is another way of analysing these data using statistical process control (SPC) which leads to very different conclusions.View this table:In this windowIn a new window Table 1 Surgeon specific mortality rates following colorectal cancer surgery In the 1920s Walter A Shewhart, a physicist, was charged with improving the quality of telephones in Bell Laboratories, USA.

This advice, in the case of attribute data, may be limiting our insights into the underlying process and consequently be potentially misleading. Given the general lack of awareness that additional insights may be obtained by using more than one SPC chart, there is a need to review this issue and make some recommendations. Under purely common cause variation the control limits on the xmr-chart and traditional attribute charts (eg, p-chart, c-chart, u-chart) will be in close agreement, indicating that the observed variation (xmr-chart) is consistent with the underlying Binomial model (p-chart) or Poisson model (c-chart, u-chart). However, when there is a material difference between the limits from the xmr-chart and the attribute chart then this also constitutes a signal of an underlying systematic special cause of variation. We use one simulation and two case studies to demonstrate these ideas and show the utility of plotting the SPC chart for attribute data alongside an xmr-chart. We conclude that the combined use of attribute charts and xmr-charts, which requires little additional effort, is a useful strategy because it is less likely to mislead us and more likely to give us the insight to do the right thing.}

Although SPC is part of an overall philosophy of continual improvement, the implementation of SPC usually requires the production of control charts. However, as SPC is relatively new to healthcare practitioners and is not routinely featured in medical statistics texts/courses, there is a need to explain the issues involved in the selection and construction of control charts in practice. Following a brief overview of SPC in healthcare and preliminary issues, we use a tutorial-based approach to illustrate the selection and construction of four commonly used control charts (xmr-chart, p-chart, u-chart, c-chart) using examples from healthcare. For each control chart, the raw data, the relevant formulae and their use and interpretation of the final SPC chart are provided together with a notes section highlighting important issues for the SPC practitioner. Some more advanced topics are also mentioned with suggestions for further reading.},

  abstract = {The Nationalist faction (Spanish: Bando nacional) or Rebel faction (Spanish: Bando sublevado) was a major faction in the Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939. It was composed of a variety of right-leaning political groups that supported the Spanish Coup of July 1936 against the Second Spanish Republic and Republican faction and sought to depose Manuel Azaña, including the Falange, the CEDA, and two rival monarchist claimants: the Alfonsist Renovación Española and the Carlist Traditionalist Communion. In 1937, all the groups were merged into the FET y de las JONS. After the death of the faction's early leaders, General Francisco Franco, one of the members of the 1936 coup, would head the Nationalists throughout most of the war and emerge as the dictator of Spain until his death in 1975. The term Nationalists or Nationals (nacionales) was coined by Joseph Goebbels following the visit of the clandestine Spanish delegation led by Captain Francisco Arranz requesting war material on 24 July 1936, in order to give a cloak of legitimacy to Nazi Germany's help to the Spanish rebel military. The leaders of the rebel faction, who had already been denominated as 'Crusaders' by Bishop of Salamanca Enrique Pla y Deniel—and also used the term Cruzada for their campaign—immediately took a liking to it. The term Bando nacional—much as the term rojos (Reds) to refer to the loyalists—is considered by some authors as a term linked with the propaganda of that faction. Throughout the civil war the term 'National' was mainly used by the members and supporters of the rebel faction, while its opponents used the terms fascistas (fascists) or facciosos (sectarians) to refer to this faction.},

  abstract = {Have you ever heard the criticism that a quality improvement project was not scientific because it was not carried out as a randomised controlled trial (RCT)? These critics have got it wrong and here is why. This answer requires a review of the scientific method. (There are lots of good references to the scientific method. See http://www.wikipedia.org on “the scientific method”.) At its core, science is based on generalisable theory. This theory leads to hypotheses which can be tested experimentally over and over again. If the test fails, the theory must be rejected or modified. Replication, not peer review, is the standard of scientific evidence. Look at the pen in your hand. There is scientific theory called gravity from which you can hypothesise that if you let go of your pen it will fall to your desk top. Drop your pen and you have tested this hypothesis and supported the theory of gravity. If instead, your pen flies into the air you may have thrown it, be on a space ship or in Harry Potter's magic arts class. The first two possibilities are well defined and predictable by the full mathematical theory of gravity. The third possibility puts us in the realm of imagination which we can enjoy, but not replicate in reality. In a way, Harry Potter's Hogwarts School is like pure mathematics. Both are built on assumptions that lead logically to imaginary behaviour or theory which are beyond our real world of experimentation. Scientific theory simplifies reality, tells us what is important, and allows us to generalise to other circumstances. It does not matter for the simple theory of gravity whether your pen is blue or black or even if it is a pencil or a penny. Theory defines what is not relevant, and what is relevant (height …}

While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for "getting the wrong answer".},

  abstract = {Racial bias in health algorithms                            The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer               et al.               find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.                                         Science               , this issue p.               447               ; see also p.               421                        ,              A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.           ,              Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

  abstract = {The conflict in Ukraine has prompted analyses about the return of cold war divisions to Europe. This study focusses on the role the news media plays in the conflict by examining how the visual and textual practices of news framing help constitute geopolitical rationality and legitimise foreign policy. We analyse how the framing of the conflict in Die Welt, Dagens Nyheter, Helsingin Sanomat and The Guardian developed through four key events between February 2014 and February 2015. The analysis indicates that by promoting particular news frames the newspapers contributed to the legitimation of European Union policies, which are premised upon supporting the Ukrainian government in its military campaign in eastern Ukraine and placing responsibility for the conflict onto Russia. Hence, we argue that the news framing eventually contributed to the naturalisation of the ‘new cold war’ as a geopolitical rationality, orienting and legitimising foreign policy in Europe.},

  abstract = {A data stream is a massive unbounded sequence of data elements continuously generated at a rapid rate. Due to this reason, most algorithms for data streams sacrifice the correctness of their results for fast processing time. The processing time is greatly influenced by the amount of information that should be maintained. This paper proposes a statistical grid-based approach to clustering data elements of a data stream. Initially, the multidimensional data space of a data stream is partitioned into a set of mutually exclusive equal-size initial cells. When the support of a cell becomes high enough, the cell is dynamically divided into two mutually exclusive intermediate cells based on its distribution statistics. Three different ways of partitioning a dense cell are introduced. Eventually, a dense region of each initial cell is recursively partitioned until it becomes the smallest cell called a unit cell. A cluster of a data stream is a group of adjacent dense unit cells. In order to minimize the number of cells, a sparse intermediate or unit cell is pruned if its support becomes much less than a minimum support. Furthermore, in order to confine the usage of memory space, the size of a unit cell is dynamically minimized such that the result of clustering becomes as accurate as possible. The proposed algorithm is analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics.},

  abstract = {As part of business analytics (BA) technologies, reporting and visualization play essential roles in mitigating users’ limitations (i.e., being inexperienced, having limited knowledge, and relying on simplified information). Reporting and visualization can potentially enhance users’ sense-making, thus permitting them to focus more on the information’s message rather than numerical analysis. To better understand the role of reporting and visualization in a contextualized environment, we investigate using interactive data visualization (IDV) within accounting. We aim to understand whether IDV can help enhance non-professional investors’ ability to make sense of foundational financial statement analyses. This study conducted an experiment using a sample of 324 nonprofessional investors. Our findings indicate that nonprofessional investors who use IDV are more heuristically adept than non-professional investors who use non-IDV. These findings enrich the theoretical understanding of business analytics’ use in accounting decision making. The results of this study also suggest several practical courses of action, such as promoting wider use of IDV and making affordable IDV more broadly available, particularly for non-professional investors.},

  abstract = {This article considers statistical process control (SPC) of univariate processes when the parametric form of the process distribution is unavailable. Most existing SPC procedures are based on the assumption that a parametric form (e.g., normal) of the process distribution can be specified beforehand. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that their performance is unreliable in cases when the prespecified process distribution is invalid. To overcome this limitation, some nonparametric (or distribution-free) SPC charts have been proposed, most of which are based on the ordering information of the observed data. This article tries to make two contributions to the nonparametric SPC literature. First, we propose an alternative framework for constructing nonparametric control charts, by first categorizing observed data and then applying categorical data analysis methods to SPC. Under this framework, some new nonparametric control charts are proposed. Second, we compare our proposed control charts with several representative existing control charts in various cases. Some empirical guidelines are provided for users to choose a proper nonparametric control chart for a specific application. This article has supplementary materials online.}

  abstract = {The declining response rates in probability surveys along with the widespread availability of unstructured data has led to growing research into non-probability samples. Existing robust approaches are not well-developed for non-Gaussian outcomes and may perform poorly in presence of influential pseudo-weights. Furthermore, their variance estimator lacks a unified framework and rely often on asymptotic theory. To address these gaps, we propose an alternative Bayesian approach using a partially linear Gaussian process regression that utilizes a prediction model with a flexible function of the pseudo-inclusion probabilities to impute the outcome variable for the reference survey. By efficiency, we mean not only computational scalability but also superiority with respect to variance. We also show that Gaussian process regression behaves as a kernel matching technique based on the estimated propensity scores, which yields double robustness and lowers sensitivity to influential pseudo-weights. Using the simulated posterior predictive distribution, one can directly quantify the uncertainty of the proposed estimator and derive associated \$95\textbackslash\%\$ credible intervals. We assess the repeated sampling properties of our method in two simulation studies. The application of this study deals with modeling count data with varying exposures under a non-probability sample setting.},

We answer this question using attitudinal and behavioral specifications of risk aversion drawn from the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). To approximate attitudinal specification of risk aversion, we use individuals’ self-reported financial risk tolerance. We use individuals’ relative risk aversion, that is, the effect of wealth on the proportion of assets categorized as risky as behavioral specification of risk aversion. We find that while women display greater attitudinal risk aversion, gender difference in behavioral risk aversion depends upon individuals’ marital status and role in household finances. Single women exhibit greater behavioral risk aversion compared to single men. However, this gender difference does not exist when we compare behavioral risk aversion of married women and men in charge of household finances.},

This is the only way one can successfully measure thoughts, emotions and other criteria that are not always openly displayed. The authors provide a practical explanation and instruction to carrying out an systematic self-observation study. They include case studies of four aspects of hidden or elusive everyday social actions: lying, telling secrets, withholding compliments and feeling envy.},

  abstract = {Current widespread implementation and practice of statistical process control (SPC) attest to the potential of SPC to contribute to continuous quality improvement efforts. While much has been written about SPC- related topics, a more fundamental question — “What does the implementation and practice of SPC entail?” — has yet to merit a detailed conceptual or empirical examination. As a result, very little knowledge has accumulated or has been documented to identify, describe, and define the requisite organizational policies and actions to make the implementation and subsequent practice of SPC an effective and viable part of any organization's quality management system. In this paper, we report on research efforts towards an enhanced conceptualization of this phenomenon; we provide various definitional perspectives on organizational efforts to implement and practice SPC, culminating in the proposition of the construct, SPC Implementation/ Practice, and its nominal definition. We also employ an empirical approach, utilizing a panel of subject-matter-experts and the affinity diagram, to identify and define a set of 14 requisite policies and actions indicative of the implementation and practice of SPC within organizations. The identification of these 14 requisite policies and actions facilitates the construction of a diagnostic instrument that organizations can employ to assess shortcomings and uncover improvement opportunities in their implementation and practice of SPC.}

Employs a standard procedure to create a measurement instrument comprising 14 measurement scales, with the number of constituent measurement items ranging from one to four, that correspond to the 14 dimensions underlying the SPC implementation/practice construct. Reports the results of assessing three properties of measurement quality for these newly‐created measurement scales, namely: face validity, internal consistency reliability and uni‐dimensionality. Such a measurement instrument can then be applied to examine antecedents and consequences of SPC implementation/practice and to diagnose existing organizational efforts at implementing and practicing SPC and to identify opportunities to improve organizational implementation and practice of this quality improvement intervention. Demonstrates the application and interpretation of the SPC implementation/practice measurement instrument within one organizational setting. Concludes by identifying future research needs.}

  abstract = {The deployment of statistical process control (SPC) in manufacturing environments is a prominent global phenomenon. Managers have frequently justified investments in SPC by citing and/or demonstrating the improvements in quality and costs from the effective implementation and practice of SPC. This paper complements this rationalization by presenting conceptual arguments and empirical evidence to further our understanding of the motivational effects that result from the deployment of SPC within production environments. Several hypotheses derived from relating the deployment of SPC to process operators' jobs and their affective reactions to work are tested using data provided by 100 process operators. The empirical results, generated from applying path analysis, suggest that the effective implementation and practice of SPC, in fact, would create more enriched jobs for process operators that lead to higher levels of work motivation and job satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Control charts, the most popular tool of statistical process control, appeared in the literature to ensure that an industrial process is operating only with natural variability, i.e., under statistical control. In the last decades, control charts have been also widely used to assess the quality of non-industrial processes, such as medicine and public health. Mainly in the last two decades, a modification of standard and advanced control charts appeared in the bibliography to improve the monitoring mainly of medical processes. This is the risk-adjusted control charts which take into consideration the varying health conditions of the patients. These charts are used to monitor certain medical processes such as surgeries, mortality, and doctors' experience. In this paper, we have tried to present all the risk-adjusted control charts presented in the literature appropriately categorized. The risk-adjusted charts have been grouped into three categories: control charts for continuous variables, control charts for attributes (non-continuous variables), time-weighted control charts. The application of risk-adjusted control charts in practical medical processes is also discussed. This review paper highlights the value of the risk-adjusted control charts.}

  abstract = {Respect for persons is a cornerstone value for any conception of research ethics--though how to best realize respect in practice is an ongoing question. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "informed consent" emerged as a particular way to operationalize respect in medical and behavioral research contexts. Today, informed consent has been challenged by increasingly advanced networked information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the massive amounts of data they produce--challenges that have led many researchers and private companies to abandon informed consent as untenable or infeasible online. Against any easy dismissal, we aim to recover insights from the history of informed consent as it developed from the late 19th century to today. With a particular focus on the United States policy context, we show how informed consent is not a fixed or monolithic concept that should be abandoned in view of new data-intensive and technological practices, but rather it is a mechanism that has always been fluid--it has constantly evolved alongside the specific contexts and practices it is intended to regulate. Building on this insight, we articulate some specific challenges and lessons from the history of informed consent that stand to benefit current discussions of informed consent and research ethics in the context of data science and Internet industry research.},

  abstract = {The choice of a pronunciation model for the 21st century learner has become a major issue of debate among applied linguists concerned with teaching English. The standard pronunciation models - Received Pronunciation and General American - have recently been confronted with a new proposal of a Lingua Franca Core (LFC) or English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), put forward as a didactic priority in teaching English pronunciation to foreigners. This volume, which includes selected contributions from the Poznań Linguistic Meetings of 2003 and 2004, does not intend to present yet another model, but sets out to place the teaching and learning of English pronunciation in the context of the 21st century. As the needs of English users are clearly changing fast in the globalizing world, the question is to what extent, if at all, models of pronunciation have been able to keep up with them, and whether they in fact should do so. Thus, key issues in the integration of pronunciation into English as L2 curricula are explored.},

  abstract = {The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles. Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a \$25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score. While The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim on its release—particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman's score, Darabont's direction and screenplay and the cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only \$16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to \$73.3 million. Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most "beloved" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".},

It is based on a systematic review of articles appearing since 2002 in major journals, supplemented by searches of the Proceedings of the American Statistical Association’s Section on Survey Methodology for unpublished papers. The article begins by drawing on responses to open-ended questions about why people are willing to participate in a hypothetical survey. It then lays out the theoretical justification for using monetary incentives and the conditions under which they are hypothesized to be particularly effective. Finally, it summarizes research on how incentives affect response rates in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and, to the extent information is available, how they affect response quality, nonresponse error, and cost-effectiveness. A special section on incentives in Web surveys is included.},

The purpose of this paper is to introduce some fundamental concepts for survival analyses in medical studies. METHODS: We comprehensively review current survival methodologies, such as the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method used to estimate survival probability, the log-rank test, one of the most popular tests for comparing survival curves, and the Cox proportional hazard model, which is used for building the relationship between survival time and specific risk factors. More advanced methods, such as time-dependent receiver operating characteristic, restricted mean survival time, and time-dependent covariates are also introduced. RESULTS: This tutorial is aimed toward covering the basics of survival analysis. We used a neurosurgical case series of surgically treated brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer patients as an example. The survival time was defined from the date of craniotomy to the date of patient death. CONCLUSIONS: This work is an attempt to encourage more investigators/medical practitioners to use survival analyses appropriately in medical research. We highlight some statistical issues, make recommendations, and provide more advanced survival modeling in this aspect.},

In doing so, we aim to facilitate more productive and precise communication around these issues, as well as more direct, application-grounded ways to mitigate them.},

  abstract = {A Google search for a person's name, such as “Trevon Jones”, may yield a personalized ad for public records about Trevon that may be neutral, such as “Looking for Trevon Jones? …”, or may be suggestive of an arrest record, such as “Trevon Jones, Arrested?...”. This writing investigates the delivery of these kinds of ads by Google AdSense using a sample of racially associated names and finds statistically significant discrimination in ad delivery based on searches of 2184 racially associated personal names across two websites.  First names, previously identified by others as being assigned at birth to more black or white babies, are found predictive of race (88\% black, 96\% white), and those assigned primarily to black babies, such as DeShawn, Darnell and Jermaine, generated ads suggestive of an arrest in 81 to 86 percent of name searches on one website and 92 to 95 percent on the other, while those assigned at birth primarily to whites, such as Geoffrey, Jill and Emma, generated more neutral copy: the word "arrest" appeared in 23 to 29 percent of name searches on one site and 0 to 60 percent on the other. On the more ad trafficked website, a black-identifying name was 25\% more likely to get an ad suggestive of an arrest record.  A few names did not follow these patterns: Dustin, a name predominantly given to white babies, generated an ad suggestive of arrest 81 and 100 percent of the time.  All ads return results for actual individuals and ads appear regardless of whether the name has an arrest record in the company’s database. Notwithstanding these findings, the company maintains Google received the same ad text for groups of last names (not first names), raising questions as to whether Google's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness.},

This poses a fundamental contradiction for AI development. Through a series of real-world case studies, we look at various aspects of where metrics go wrong in practice and aspects of how our online environment and current business practices are exacerbating these failures. Finally, we propose a framework towards mitigating the harms caused by overemphasis of metrics within AI by: (1) using a slate of metrics to get a fuller and more nuanced picture, (2) combining metrics with qualitative accounts, and (3) involving a range of stakeholders, including those who will be most impacted.},

DATA SOURCES: Original articles found in relevant databases, including Web of Science and Medline, covering the period 1966 to June 2004. STUDY SELECTION: From 311 articles, 57 empirical studies, published between 1990 and 2004, met the inclusion criteria. METHODS: A standardised data abstraction form was used for extracting data relevant to the review questions, and the data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Statistical process control was applied in a wide range of settings and specialties, at diverse levels of organisation and directly by patients, using 97 different variables. The review revealed 12 categories of benefits, 6 categories of limitations, 10 categories of barriers, and 23 factors that facilitate its application and all are fully referenced in this report. Statistical process control helped different actors manage change and improve healthcare processes. It also enabled patients with, for example asthma or diabetes mellitus, to manage their own health, and thus has therapeutic qualities. Its power hinges on correct and smart application, which is not necessarily a trivial task. This review catalogs 11 approaches to such smart application, including risk adjustment and data stratification. CONCLUSION: Statistical process control is a versatile tool which can help diverse stakeholders to manage change in healthcare and improve patients' health.}

However, researchers must make several thoughtful and evidence-based methodological decisions while conducting an EFA, and there are a number of options available at each decision point, some better than others. Reviews of the professional literature have consistently found that many applications of EFA are marked by an injudicious choice of methods and incomplete reports. This article provides a systematic, evidence-based guide to the conduct of EFA studies that can be followed by researchers with modest statistical training, supplemented with an example to illustrate its application.},

In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area) is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801.Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and the mass media. However, they have been criticized, and many experts recommend avoiding them, as research has shown it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. Pie charts can be replaced in most cases by other plots such as the bar chart, box plot, dot plot, etc.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Survey data collection costs have risen to a point where many survey researchers and polling companies are abandoning large, expensive probability-based samples in favor of less expensive nonprobability samples. The empirical literature suggests this strategy may be suboptimal for multiple reasons, among them that probability samples tend to outperform nonprobability samples on accuracy when assessed against population benchmarks. However, nonprobability samples are often preferred due to convenience and costs. Instead of forgoing probability sampling entirely, we propose a method of combining both probability and nonprobability samples in a way that exploits their strengths to overcome their weaknesses within a Bayesian inferential framework. By using simulated data, we evaluate supplementing inferences based on small probability samples with prior distributions derived from nonprobability data. We demonstrate that informative priors based on nonprobability data can lead to reductions in variances and mean squared errors for linear model coefficients. The method is also illustrated with actual probability and nonprobability survey data. A discussion of these findings, their implications for survey practice, and possible research extensions are provided in conclusion.},

Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters.

  abstract = {Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior. Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology’s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

  abstract = {Purpose               – Internet data hold many promises for demographic research, but come with severe drawbacks due to several types of bias. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature that uses internet data for demographic studies and presents a general framework for addressing the problem of selection bias in non-representative samples.                                         Design/methodology/approach               – The authors propose two main approaches to reduce bias. When ground truth data are available, the authors suggest a method that relies on calibration of the online data against reliable official statistics. When no ground truth data are available, the authors propose a difference in differences approach to evaluate relative trends.                                         Findings               – The authors offer a generalization of existing techniques. Although there is not a definite answer to the question of whether statistical inference can be made from non-representative samples, the authors show that, when certain assumptions are met, the authors can extract signal from noisy and biased data.                                         Research limitations/implications               – The methods are sensitive to a number of assumptions. These include some regularities in the way the bias changes across different locations, different demographic groups and between time steps. The assumptions that we discuss might not always hold. In particular, the scenario where bias varies in an unpredictable manner and, at the same time, there is no “ground truth” available to continuously calibrate the model, remains challenging and beyond the scope of this paper.                                         Originality/value               – The paper combines a critical review of existing substantive and methodological literature with a generalization of prior techniques. It intends to provide a fresh perspective on the issue and to stimulate the methodological discussion among social scientists.},

  abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of               clusters,               or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named               BIRCH               (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases.               BIRCH               incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints).               BIRCH               can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans.               BIRCH               is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate               BIRCH               's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of               BIRCH               versus               CLARANS,               a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that               BIRCH               is consistently superior.},

  abstract = {The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects. We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data. This essay elaborates on the ways Big Data impacts on ethical conceptions.},

  abstract = {Mange barn bruker mye tid på nettet, enten de ser på videoer, spiller spill eller snakker med venner eller fremmede over sosiale medier. Mange ulike plattformer er skapt med barn som målgruppe. Dette har muliggjort at barn kan treffe nye venner og holde kontakt med de uten fysisk å møtes. Selv om disse plattformene kan bidra til å øke barns sosiale krets, kan de òg ha mørkere sider ved seg. Plattformer på nett gir tilgang til samtaler med barn for folk med dårlige hensikter. På disse plattformene kan overgripere komme i kontakt med barn med lav risiko for å bli avslørt. Denne masteravhandlingen forsøker å finne en metode for å gjenkjenne overgripere på nett ved hjelp av grafteori. Det eksisterer prosjekter som studerer deteksjon av overgripere på nett fra før av. Størsteparten av disse benytter tekstlig analyse, og flere kan vise til gode resultater. Analysene går ut på å finne ord eller fraseringer som er mer typisk for en overgriper å bruke enn et barn. Det er flere utfordringer med å analysere tekst i overgrepsdeteksjon. Når man lager et system for analyse av tekstmeldinger vil analysen kun fungere på det språket som systemet ble laget i. Det vil ikke være mulig å lage et deteksjonsprogram som kan fungere uavhengig av språket. En annen utfordring er mengden uformelt språk i tekstmeldinger. Tekstmeldinger inneholder gjerne mer slang, skrivefeil og generelt uformelt språk, som er utfordrende for maskiner å tolke.  For å unngå utfordringene som er beskrevet i prosjekter med tekstanalyse for overgrepsdeteksjon, vil vi bruke grafteori for deteksjon av overgripere på nett. Et datasett fra en chatteplattform med barn som målgruppe, vil presenteres som en graf. Brukerne blir representert av noder, og meldingene som sendes mellom brukerene representeres av kanter. Hovedmålet med arbeidet er å finne ut om det mulig å gjenkjenne en overgriper ved å studere egenskapene til de ulike nodene i grafen.  Vi har gjennom studiet designet og implementert et sett av funksjoner som har blitt brukt i flere forskjellige klyngealgoritmer. Fra resultatene av klyngealgoritmene har vi funnet flere brukere som vi anser som sannsynlige overgripere. Vi har til slutt studert anonymiserte tekstmeldinger som er sendt fra relevante brukere for å konkludere om de er overgriper eller ikke. Gjennom denne studien, har vi funnet ut at grafteori kan brukes som metode for overgrepsdeteksjon på nett. Videre bør både ikke-overvåket og overvåket maskinlæring i statiske og dynamiske grafer bli studert videre for å finne en mer presis metode for å finne brukere med unormal oppførsel.},
